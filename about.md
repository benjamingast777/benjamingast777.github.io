# About Me

I am Ben Gast, a senior at Ohio University pursuing a dual major in Finance and Management Information Systems (MIS). I’ve always been motivated by the belief that hard work, curiosity, and persistence open doors that talent alone cannot. My approach to learning and work is grounded in taking initiative, seeking challenges, and continually improving through experience. I take pride in balancing technical precision with business understanding—whether I’m developing a Power BI dashboard, analyzing a financial model, or troubleshooting a network issue.  

Throughout my time at Ohio University, I have built a foundation that combines finance, analytics, and technology. What drives me most is the pursuit of understanding how data shapes business strategy and how technology can be used to solve real-world problems. I’ve sought out opportunities that stretch my comfort zone—working in managed services, IT risk consulting, and data analysis—to build a perspective that bridges both business and technical disciplines. I believe that success comes from consistency, accountability, and a willingness to adapt, and I aim to bring that mindset into every project or organization I join.

## Professional Experience

**Valeo Networks – Centralized Services Intern**  
At Valeo Networks, I work on the centralized services team, assisting in the management of Datto cloud backups, endpoint monitoring, and infrastructure health. I’ve been responsible for maintaining service alerts, ensuring data protection consistency across client environments, and improving the quality of internal performance reporting. Through collaboration with senior engineers, I’ve helped streamline alert resolution processes and contributed to projects that improve system reliability and response times. My work has strengthened my understanding of IT operations, business continuity, and the importance of proactive service management.

**RSM US LLP – Technology Risk Consulting Intern**  
As part of RSM’s Risk Advisory practice, I contributed to technology risk assessments across multiple industries. My role focused on testing IT General Controls (ITGCs), reviewing SOC reports, and evaluating system configurations for control effectiveness. I gained experience working with frameworks such as COSO, COBIT, and NIST, while learning how compliance and technology intersect with business risk. This experience gave me insight into how organizations balance innovation with control, and it sharpened my analytical thinking and attention to detail—skills that translate well into both finance and data analytics.

**Splicenet Consulting – IT Support Technician**  
During my time at Splicenet Consulting, I supported a variety of small and mid-sized business clients in managing their IT infrastructure. My responsibilities included remote troubleshooting, system updates, and data backup verification using Datto and Veeam. I also documented technical procedures to improve internal consistency and knowledge sharing. This experience gave me a strong foundation in customer communication, problem-solving, and understanding the practical side of IT management in fast-paced business environments.
