It focuses on profitability and revenue performance across multiple channels and regions, giving management a quick way to evaluate operational health and profitability margins.

### Dashboard Summary

This dashboard analyzes a dataset of over 600 data professionals to uncover patterns across job titles, salaries, and satisfaction levels.  
The visualizations highlight how factors such as country, experience, and programming language relate to pay and overall job outlook.  

### Dashboard Summary
- Average salary by role (Data Scientist, Engineer, Analyst, Architect, etc.)  
- Country distribution of survey participants  
- Difficulty of breaking into the field, rated by respondents  
- Overall work-life balance and salary satisfaction metrics  

The project focused on visual storytelling — taking a raw dataset and shaping it into a report that delivers clear, visual insights.  
It emphasized data modeling, the creation of calculated measures, and clean Power BI formatting for presentation clarity.

Tools used: Power BI, DAX, Excel
